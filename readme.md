Fancy a cup?

[coffee-sales](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ihelon/coffee-sales) is one of [Kaggle's](https://www.kaggle.com/) best
rated datasets. The dataset contains detailed records of sales for a coffee vending machine in Ukraine :ukraine: 

This repo performs a tiny application of ML algorithms(logistic regression & random forests) to predict if you'll pay cash or card depending on the following features:

- The coffee has milk
- The coffee has chocolate
- The name of the coffee

ðŸ’¡ It can be debated that the latter describes the first 2, but I decided to expand them as standalone features to display my feature engineering skills :godmode:

### The conclusion

Chocolate and milk on a cup of coffee are not strong descriptors to define if one will pay for coffee with cash or card
