Fancy a cup?

[coffee-sales](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ihelon/coffee-sales) is one of [Kaggle's](https://www.kaggle.com/) best
rated datasets.

The dataset contains detailed records of sales for a coffee vending machine in Ukraine :flag-ua:

This repository performs a succint application of ML algorithms with the purposes to predict various aspects of coffee sales such as:

- Predicting wether or not a coffee will have milk based on the time of the day
- Predicting wether the coffee sale will be made with cash or card
- Predicting the hour of the day where the most coffee will be sold
- Predicting the hour of the day where the most espresso + milk will be sold
- Predicting the hour of the day where the most money is spent on coffee
- Predicting where the most money is made when selling coffee based on the week of the month

My goal is to showcase my new found skills in the realm of machine learning & data engineering. 

If you enjoyed the study be sure to pour yourself a strong one :godmode:
